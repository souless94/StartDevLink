# StartDevLink
This is a side project, aims to bridge the gap between startup founders looking for technical expertise and developers eager to build innovative products. With StartDevLink, founders can post their requirements for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and developers can browse these opportunities to find exciting projects to collaborate on.
